    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across the blog post <a href="http://sirupsen.com/what-I-wish-a-ruby-programmer-had-told-me-one-year-ago/" target="_blank">“What I Wish a Ruby Programmer Had Told Me One Year Ago”</a> and started reading through the author Simon’s code for the first iteration of his todo app to figure out what was going on.  One method he used was:
<code>ruby
def [](id)
  @list[id]
end
</code>
This had me pretty confused at first. Then when I looked at how he was running the code I saw he was calling this method like you would access an element in an array.
<code>ruby
list = TodoList.load("todo.td")
list[0].done = true
</code>
It turns out in Ruby you can use special characters to name methods including the array lookup syntax, square brackets.  In this way he names the method <code>[ ]</code> and passes it an <code>(id)</code>, which is then passed to the array <code>@list</code> to lookup that element in the <code>@list</code> array.  Essentially he’s creating a lookup on the instance of his class <code>TodoList</code>, so he can use <code>[ ]</code> to lookup specific todo items just like he would if here were accessing them in array, which technically he is&hellip;the @list array.  Pretty Cool!</p>
